# Deep Neural Network From Scratch
### Deep Neural Network that classifies cat vs. non-cat images.

Implementation of all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks to build a neural network of any architecture we want.
Can experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.
